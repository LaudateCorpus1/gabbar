# Best practices


## Performance
- One feature modification changesets are super fast to process in comparison to changesets with more features. Thus, prototype on changesets with one features before scaling to changesets with more than one features touched.

## It is ok to be wrong
It is not required at this stage of the project to be able to flag 100% of harmful features. This is an iterative process. Dumping lots of features in the hope of flagging 100% of the harmful features is actually decremental on the model performance.
